# ACFM Pesticide Inventory Application

## Overview

Managing records for large volumes of concentrated and premixed pesticide formulations can be challenging. This application streamlines inventory maintenance, making it easier for employees to keep accurate records. By acting as a centralized source of truth accessible to all authorized personnel, the application significantly reduces the time spent searching for premixed formulations. This efficiency helps project managers and staff minimize the volume of premixed containers in storage, leading to substantial cost savings on compliance and infrastructure. Additionally, it reduces the risk of expired formulations, benefiting both the company and the environment.

This app allows employees to:

- view all of the premixed containers and concentrates in inventory and their quantities
- search for specific premixes with up to 2 different products and concentrations
- add, remove, and update products and premixed containers in inventory
- see when a premix is soon to expire
